# Wapipo

Wapipo is a CLI tool for broadcasting WhatsApp messages to a list of participants.

## Installation

Coming soon.


## Usage
```bash
wapipo blast -p <participants_file> -m <message_file> -d <webdriver_path>
```

Here's what each option does:

- `-p, --participants <dir>`: The directory of the participants file. This file should contain one phone number per line.
- `-m, --message <dir>`: The directory of the message file. This file should contain the message you want to broadcast.
- `-d, --driver <path>`: The path to the webdriver. *If not provided, Wapipo will use a default driver based on your OS*.
